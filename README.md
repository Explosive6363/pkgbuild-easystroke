# Easystroke_n7n: Archlinux Package

![My Image](/images/easystroke.png)

My own Archlinux package for Easystroke Gesture Recognition Software.

Rational: the AUR packages are poorly maintained and currently broken && I am
also using my own fork of Easystroke, so that i can make use of modern changes 
found in other (newer) forks of the software.

My Easystroke source code repo is found here:
